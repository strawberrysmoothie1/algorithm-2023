The Air Filtering Tower That Could Clean City Air
A team of architects in New Delhi, India, hopes it has found an answer to the city's pollution problem — and it's something that could be used across the world.

Named Verto, it is a 5.5-meter-high tower that filters and purifies the air around it, reducing levels of things like nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5.

The first tower — a prototype — has been filtering 600,000 cubic meters of air every day since the summer of 2022 in Sunder Nursery park in New Delhi — one of the world's most polluted cities.

Special electric fans suck the air inside the tower, where it is filtered.

The designers, from a company called Studio Symbiosis, say the fans are able to slow down and save energy when they don't need to work so hard, such as when it's windy.

And they say a tower placed outside can clean the air as far as 350 meters away.

So could they start cleaning up whole cities? Amit Gupta, one of Studio Symbiosis' founders, thinks so. He told CNN that it might take 100 of them to begin cleaning the air in New Delhi, although further research is needed.

And the company's co-founder, Amit's wife Britta Knobel Gupta, said she'd like to see the towers installed in public places where people enjoy spending time, like parks.

The husband-and-wife team, who are successful architects, said there has been interest in Verto from across the world.

Although the towers look stylish, they are not silent — CNN compared the noise they make to a kitchen blender.

But air pollution caused almost 1.6 million deaths in India in 2019 according to The Lancet, so that noise may not be seen as a very significant problem.
